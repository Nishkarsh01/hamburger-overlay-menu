# hamburger-overlay-menu
This is an Overlay Menu created using HTML, CSS. No Javascript has been use. Through this project I deep dived into css topics like animations, keyframes, transitions, properties like transform, etc. I got to learn a lot and the project was quite fun to develop.
Feel free to get ideas.
